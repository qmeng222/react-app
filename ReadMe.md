## Setup:

1. Start a new Vite project by automating the setup and configuration steps: `npm create vite@4.1.0`
   - project creation tool: Vite
   - framework: React
   - variant: Typescript
2. (For project isolation) create & activate a virtual environment (dependencies are installed within the virtual environment other than system-wide & all subsequent steps will be performed within the virtual environment):
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install all the dependencies and devDependencies listed in the `package.json` file: `npm install` or `npm i`
4. Start a development web server for the projec: `npm run dev`
